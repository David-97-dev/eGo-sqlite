# eGo-sqlite

#### eGo | alpha - Electric Charge Point Mapper and Database Generator
#### This programme makes use of the UK GOV database on electric charge points and their locations.
#### You can update the database, do a manual search and generate a folium based map.
#### This version uses the sqlite database package to create a virtual database within python.
####  Other work-in-progress versions use MySQL server databases to retrieve and store data.
#### This programme will eventually be used to build geospatial visual analytics for use within the sector.
